<h2>Blog posts</h2>
<!--
    I tried applying the sortPostsByActualDate directly to the loop, but liquid did not like that.
    So I had to use the assign keyword from liquid to create a variable called sortedPosts and set
    that variable to the collections.posts filtered through my custom filter in .eleventy.js 
    that sorted all the posts regardless of source
-->
{% assign sortedPosts = collections.posts | sortPostsByActualDate %}
{% for post in sortedPosts %}
    <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a></h3>
    <p>{{ post.date }}</p>
    <p>{{ post.data.description }}</p>
{% endfor %}
